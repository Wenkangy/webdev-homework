              a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter 
              don't get off counter walk on keyboard . I'm bored inside, let me out i'm 
              lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, 
              guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe 
              for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air 
              in greatest offense! attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened. Fart 
              in owners food hopped up on catnip, and sleeping in the box and claw drapes, 
              or cat ass trophy and swipe at owner's legs. Chase the pig around the house 
              leave fur on owners clothes but lick human with sandpaper tongue murder hooman 
              toes. Check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in poop in a handbag
